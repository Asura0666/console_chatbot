Asura is a powerful race in the Super Gene universe, originating from a spirit that was exiled from the God Sanctuaries after killing a God-level being from the 5th God Sanctuary and subsequently founding the Sura.
 This spirit, known as Asura, was originally from another dimension but reincarnated as a spirit in the 3rd God Sanctuary after its dimension was reset.
 The Asura race is characterized by their distinct physical traits, including chifres (horns) that symbolize their identity—black for civilians, white for elites, gold for aristocrats, and purple for royalty—and the use of masks that hold significant meaning.
 Their blood is notably green, resembling bile, which serves as a distinguishing feature from humans.

Asura are known for their immense physical strength, with even the weakest capable of matching evolved humans in hand-to-hand combat, and the strongest surpassing Transcendents.
 They are a major force in the conflict between humanity and the Asura race, having been involved in a long-standing war that spanned centuries. The Asura race is also linked to the Falsified-Sky Sutra, a powerful technique originally created by the spirit Asura and later known as the Asura Sutra or Sky-Demon Sutra in the Great Geneverse.
 This technique is typically restricted to members of the Luo Family due to their mixed human and Shura bloodline, which grants them the necessary heritage to wield it without fatal consequences.
 However, Zero, who shares a similar lineage, is also able to learn and use the Falsified-Sky Sutra, suggesting her connection to Asura heritage.

The Asura race is also tied to the broader narrative of the Geno Hall and the Sacred Leader, with Asura being one of the 13 generals under Chaos who controlled the 13 skies between the positive and negative universes.
 After the universe was reset, Asura and her subordinates were scattered into the lower sanctuaries, where they lost their memories, except for Ancient Devil, who was secretly working for Han Jinzhi.
 Han Jinzhi later made a secret deal with Asura, giving her his powers and fusing the Geno Hall Leader part of his soul with her, forcing her to ascend directly to the 6th God Sanctuary.
 This unnatural ascension left the Shura in a paradoxical state where they could neither level up nor use the sanctuary system to correct themselves.

Zero, a central character, is theorized to be a clone created from Asura’s genes, possibly a test subject designed to serve as a control terminal for the sanctuaries.
 Her physical resemblance to Asura and her ability to use the Falsified-Sky Sutra support this theory, though the author has not confirmed her origins definitively.
 The Asura race's legacy is further complicated by their connection to the Luo Family and the broader conflict involving the Crystalizers, the Sacred Leader, and the ultimate goal of creating a body compatible with the negative universe.
